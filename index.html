         <p> David Brown - Lead Developer </p>

          "As the Lead Developer at Retro Games, I'm constantly inspired by the classics. My top three picks are Final Fantasy VI, Street Fighter II, and Metroid. Final Fantasy VI has an epic story and complex characters that still resonate with me. Street Fighter II revolutionized fighting games and remains the gold standard in the genre. And Metroid is a masterpiece of exploration and atmosphere. These games not only shaped my career but also fueled my passion for creating unforgettable gaming experiences for our customers."

          <p>Jessica Turner - Marketing Manager </p>

          "Working at Retro Games is a dream come true for me, as I've always been a huge fan of retro gaming. My top three favorite games are The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Mario World, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. A Link to the Past captivates me with its immersive world and timeless story. Super Mario World is pure joy, with its perfect blend of challenging levels and charming graphics. And Sonic 2? It's simply the best when it comes to speed and excitement. These games are more than just entertainment; they represent a pivotal part of gaming history."
